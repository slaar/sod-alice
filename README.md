Lua implementation of KoL's Alice's Army minigame for custom EQ server.



This uses standard Everquest mobs to graphically depict the epic card-game battle that takes place in every instance of Alice's Army (the cute M:tG tribute in Kingdom of Loathing).

And by 'graphically depict' I mean that the monsters show up each side in a line as in a standard AA game and then play proceeds as normal.  When "cards" die, they collapse and the relevant queue bunches up.  All special attacks are as written in the rules of AA.
